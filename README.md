### Description
This is a project aimed at making a framework for detecting objects and their respective positions on a ground plane, specifically game pieces in FIRST Robotics competitions. This project uses the YOLOv8 framework and onnx ai format to optimize for SBC's like the OrangePi or RaspberryPi. This is still in the development fase with bad Github practices as it is only meant for my robotics team @frc3322.
### Usage
To use this you should only have to run main.py and it will start detection, you can edit constants.py if camera or other settings have changed and if you want to train a new model read the readme in model_creation
